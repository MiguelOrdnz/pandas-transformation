An outstanding, exceptional woman of God, always available to assist someone in need, she cannot be replaced and will be missed. One of 4 children born to the union of Reverend Sam Jr. and Barbara Jean Chase, she was proceeded in death by them and her oldest brother, Sam III. Following her high school graduation from John Adams High School (South Bend, Indiana) she furthered her education at Beulah Heights University, receiving both a Bachelor of Arts (Summa Cum Laude) and a Master's degree in Business Administration. Entering the workforce, she was employed at Dyer and Payne as an administrative assistant for over 13 years. Marilyn considered her co-workers to be further extensions of her constantly expanding circle of family, friends, and acquaintances. Marilyn was a lifelong member of the Christian faith, as well as an associate minister at her beloved church, Fellowship of Prayer International. Phenomenally gifted as a singer, (from the age of 4) at FOPI she served as praise and worship leader in addition to her position on the ministerial staff. Worship was one of her most fervent passions, and leading God's people into worship was a task she handled inspirationally. Respected, and admired by her church family, she adored them as well, adopting them all into her extended family circle. In 1976, she started a 43-year marital journey by marrying her high school sweetheart (Danny Ronell), who survives her. She is also survived by her 3 cherished and treasured daughters, Donyalla Manns, Darra McClendon (Shaine), and Danica Manns, her most prized gem, granddaughter Hayley, her beloved sister (and best friend) Sabrina Chase, her adored brother, Reverend Michael R. Chase (Michelle), and current family patriarch Uncle Simuel Chase. The survivors list also include a host of nieces, nephews, God-children, friends, acquaintances, special friends and associates. Marilyn was the definition of a people person and added almost daily to this list. There will be a celebration of Marilyn's life of accomplishments on Saturday October 26, 2019 at 5 pm at Fellowship of Prayer International Church, 3940 Cascade Road, Atlanta GA, 30331.
